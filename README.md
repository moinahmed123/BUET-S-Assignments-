# BUET-S-Assignments:
Ques.No-1:

Write a C program that takes an unsigned integer number as input, then forms two new numbers n1 and n2. n1 is made with the bits of the even positions, and n2 is made with the bits of the odd positions. Find the number that is bigger among n1 and n2.

Example:
Input:37-100101
100 011
4 3
Output:4

Input - Output
 37   -  4
  8   -  2
  5   -  3
  299 -  17

Example :
Input:53-110101
1110-14
Output:14

Input - Output
 53  -  14
 73   -  0
